The references to 'social justice institutions', 'tackling inequality', and 'supporting the individuals and institutions working tirelessly to address the underlying drivers of inequality' imply a focus on nonprofit, nongovernmental, and civil society organizations working in these areas. The 'BUILD' initiative also suggests a preference for collaborative efforts and network-building. However, the specific eligibility criteria for individual grant programs are still unclear.",
